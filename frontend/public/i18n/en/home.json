        "question": "Why do I need a link in bio tool?",

Instead of constantly updating your bio link, you can create a single landing page with all your important links, content, and products. It's essential for creators, businesses, and anyone who wants to maximize their social media presence."

      {
        "question": "Is Portyo free to use?",

        "question": "How is Portyo different from Linktree?",

      },
      {
        "question": "Can I use my own domain?",
        "answer": "Yes! With our Standard and Pro plans, you can connect your own custom domain to your Portyo page. This gives you a professional branded URL like yourname.com instead of portyo.me/yourname."
      },
      {
        "question": "Is Portyo safe to use on all social media platforms?",
        "answer": "Yes, Portyo is completely safe and compliant with all major social media platforms including Instagram, TikTok, Twitter, YouTube, and more. We follow all platform guidelines and best practices."
